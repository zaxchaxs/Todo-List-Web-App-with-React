# This is the result of my practice in learning React and Next.js.
### I am trying to create a to-do list web app that connects to an API that I have created myself [TodoList API](https://github.com/zaxchaxs/TodoList-API-Project)

 
## If you're curious about the results of my exercise, you can follow the steps below.

First, install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.
After that, run the API first so that when the application is executed, it can directly connect to the API that I created.
And then, you can run the server with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project runs on localhost:3000, while the API I created is running on localhost:5000.

### To run the API I created, you can refer to the documentation provided in the README file in my [TodoList Api](https://github.com/zaxchaxs/TodoList-API-Project) repository.
